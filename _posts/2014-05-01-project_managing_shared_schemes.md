#Project - Managing Shared Schemes
---

In order to build and run your tests on Distiller (or any other continuous integration service), you must create a Shared Scheme for your application target.

To create a Shared Scheme:

1. Open up your project in Xcode.

2. Open up the Manage Schemes sheet by selecting Product > Scheme > Manage Schemes

3. Locate the application target in the list. Make sure the “Shared” checkbox on the far right is checked.

4. Check this file into your repository and use this Shared Scheme in your Distiller project configuration.
